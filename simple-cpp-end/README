Jens Pfau's c++ code for his Physica A paper from

http://ww2.cs.mu.oz.au/~pfauj/physicaa2012/physicaa2012-cpp.zip

modified by Alex Stivala to paralleize on MPI system using mpi4py
in conjunction with physica2012-python-mpi (modified version of Jens's 
Python scripts)

Version with simple Axelrod model, no extensions (ie no social network,
migration), infinite range interactions.
