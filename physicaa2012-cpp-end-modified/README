Jens Pfau's c++ code for his Physica A paper from

http://ww2.cs.mu.oz.au/~pfauj/physicaa2012/physicaa2012-cpp.zip

modified by Alex Stivala to paralleize on MPI system using mpi4py
in conjunction with physica2012-python-mpi (modified version of Jens's 
Python scripts)

Version with new teriminatino criteria [function stop2()] that should
terminate ONLY at actual equilibrium not just when no state change since
last timestep.

Have corrected stop2(), this version checks equilirbium
condition s = 1 \/ s = 0 \/ s < theta,  (s is culture similarity)
and in addition,
also checks that social link weights (w) are correspondingly 0 or 1, ie

(s(i,j) = 1 /\ w(i,j) = 1) \/ (s(i,j) = 0 /\ w(i,j) = 0) \/ 
 (s(i,j) < theta /\ w(i,j) = 0)

for all pairs of agents (i,j).

This version has the new definition of theta threshold, ie that 
instead of no interaction happening if similarity < theta, it is a 
failed intertaction. So something happens at every iteration.

Also runngin with only beta_s = 1 not 10 has values > 1 are too slow to
converge.
